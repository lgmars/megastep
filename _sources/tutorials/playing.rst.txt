Playing With Megastep
=====================
While the :ref:`Minimal Environment <minimal-env>` tutorial is extremely detailed, it's not particularly *fun*. This 
tutorial instead takes an existing interesting environment and tasks you to adapt it in specific ways. In solving
these tasks, you'll learn how megastep is structured while hopefully keeping the problem-solving part of your brain
from losing interest.

The best way to do these experiments is in a `notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`_ of some sort. In a pinch, you can 
also use `this Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16X2fgapozFAgnkDCS1o-UzR7Gcg6vIrg?usp=sharing>`_.
The main problem is the font rendering is a bit weird.

At the bottom of the page are some links to :ref:`resources <playing-resources>` you might find helpful with these.

Run the Demo
************
:ref:`Install megastep <install>` and record an untrained :mod:`~megastep.demo` agent::

    from megastep.demo import *
    env = explorer.Explorer(1)
    agent = Agent(env).cuda()
    demo(env=env, agent=agent, length=64) 

Swap Out The Geometry
*********************
Copy and paste the code for the :class:`~megastep.demo.envs.minimal.Minimal` env and replace the default toy geometry
:ref:`geometry <geometry>` with :mod:`~megastep.cubicasa` geometry. Plot it to check that it works::

    env = AlteredMinimal()
    env.reset()
    env.display()

Triangular Geometry
*******************
Read the :github:`toy geometry code <megastep/toys.py>` and alter it to write your own triangular-box geometry. Try 
it out with :func:`~megastep.geometry.display`::

    from megastep import geometry
    geometry.display(tri)

Change the Lights
*****************
Copy and paste the code for the :class:`~megastep.demo.envs.minimal.Minimal` env, and replace the :func:`~megastep.scene.scenery` 
call with your own function. Have this function first call the original scene function, but then modify its baked
lighting to be all 1s. Check that it works with :func:`~megastep.scene.display`::

    from megastep import scene
    scene.display(bright)

Change the Colours
******************
Copy and paste the code for the :class:`~megastep.demo.envs.minimal.Minimal` env, and replace the :func:`~megastep.scene.scenery` 
call with your own function. Have this function first call the original scene function, but then modify its 
textures to be all white. Check that it works with :func:`~megastep.scene.display`::

    from megastep import scene
    scene.display(white)

.. _changeobs:

Change the Observations
***********************
Copy and paste the code for the :class:`~megastep.demo.envs.minimal.Minimal` env, and replace the RGB observations 
with a :class:`~megastep.modules.Depth` observation. Alter the ``plot_state`` method so you can see your change in 
action::

    from megastep.demo import *
    env = AlteredMinimal()
    agent = Agent(env).cuda()
    demo(env=env, agent=agent, length=64) 

Custom Observations
*******************
**Trickier**. Write a module like :class:`~megastep.modules.Depth` that returns a visualization of *indices* 
of the lines it's looking at. You'll want to read the :class:`~megastep.cuda.Render` documentation.

Check it works by copying and pasting the code for the :class:`~megastep.demo.envs.minimal.Minimal` env, 
then running it through the demo recorder::

    from megastep.demo import *
    env = AlteredMinimal()
    agent = Agent(env).cuda()
    demo(env=env, agent=agent, length=64) 

To get this to work, you'll need to update the ``plot_state`` and the observation space too.

Change the Movement
*******************
Copy and paste the code for the :class:`~megastep.demo.envs.minimal.Minimal` env, and replace the jump-y simple-motion
actions with :class:`~megastep.modules.MomentumMovement`. Check that it works with the demo recorder::

    from megastep.demo import *
    env = AlteredMinimal()
    agent = Agent(env).cuda()
    demo(env=env, agent=agent, length=64) 

Custom Movement
***************
**Trickier**. Write a module like :class:`~megastep.modules.MomentumMovement` that teleports the agent in a different
direction depending on which action is chosen.

Check it works by copying and pasting the code for the :class:`~megastep.demo.envs.minimal.Minimal` env, 
then running it through the demo recorder::

    from megastep.demo import *
    env = AlteredMinimal()
    agent = Agent(env).cuda()
    demo(env=env, agent=agent, length=64) 

Custom Spawning
***************
**Trickier**. Write a module like :class:`~megastep.modules.RandomSpawns` that spawns the even-numbered agents facing 
right and the odd-numbered agents facing left.  

Check it works by copying and pasting the code for the :class:`~megastep.demo.envs.minimal.Minimal` env, 
increasing the number of agents, then resetting and displaying it::

    from megastep.demo import *
    env = AlteredMinimal()
    env.reset()
    env.display()

Multiple Actions
****************
**Trickier**. Copy and paste the code for the :class:`~megastep.demo.envs.minimal.Minimal` env, and add a second set
of actions in parallel to the movement actions that cause the agent to respawn at a random location. Multiple actions
are not used in either of the examples, so to point you in the right direction, you want your action space to look
like this::

    self.action_space = dotdict.dotdict(
        movement=self.movement.space,
        respawn=spaces.MultiDiscrete(self.n_agents, 2))

Check it works by running it through the demo recorder::

    from megastep.demo import *
    env = AlteredMinimal()
    agent = Agent(env).cuda()
    demo(env=env, agent=agent, length=64)     

Custom Agents
*************
**Trickier**. The default :class:`~megastep.demo.Agent` in the demo class uses a neural net to control things. Rewrite
it to go forward while it's more than 2m away from the nearest object in its field of vision, and to go backward when
it's less than 1m away.

Test it out on :class:`~megastep.demo.envs.explorer.Explorer` env, which has a depth observation by default. You 
may want to have a look through the source for the :class:`~megastep.modules.Depth` module to understand how depth is
perceived.

Check it works by running it through the demo recorder::

    from megastep.demo import *
    env = Explorer()
    agent = Agent(env).cuda()
    demo(env=env, agent=agent, length=64)    

Watch It Learn
**************
**Trickiest**. The default demo has a :func:`~megastep.demo.train` func that'll train an exploration agent in ~ten 
minutes on a RTX 2080 TI. Check that it works. You can view how training is progressing by opening a second notebook 
and, after training has begun, running ::

    from rebar import plots; 
    plots.view()

This is using my entirely undocumented :mod:`~megastep.rebar` toolkit, which is why I've marked it as trickiest. You 
can watch demos as the agent learns by running ::

    from megastep.demo import *
    demo(run=-1, length=64)

It'll start off moving randomly, but as the reward improves it'll get obviously better.

.. _playing-resources:

Resources
*********
Here are some tools that might help with these tasks.

:ref:`API reference <api>`
    The API reference describes the details of megastep in one place. If you decide you want to alter the `FOV
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view>`_ of the agents for example, a good way to go about it would be 
    to go to the API reference and Ctrl+F for 'FOV'.

    The API reference also links to the source of the code it's documenting; if you don't find the detail you want
    in the docs themselves, clicking through to the source code will often give you an answer.

:ref:`Concepts <concepts>`
    There are some ideas in megastep - like 'agents' - which turn up in too many places to document them again and 
    again every time they're used. Instead, there's a Concepts page which gives a brief overview of each of these ideas.

:ref:`FAQ <faq>`
    The FAQ tries to preempt some common questions. It remains to be seen how good of a job I've done with it.

:ref:`Tutorials <tutorials>`
    If you're reading this you probably don't want to read the more in-depth tutorials, but they may still be useful
    as something to Ctrl+F through when you're after a specific bit of code.

IPython Help
    You can follow any object in an IPython session `with ? to get the docs for that object, or ?? to get 
    the source code for that object <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/python-ipython-diff.html#accessing-help>`_.

    ?? will also give you the filepath of the code underlying the object, which is useful for the next bit.

Library Breakpoints
    If you're curious how a library is doing a specific thing and just looking at the code isn't helpful, you can 
    use ?? to find the path to the code on your system and open that path in an editor. Then you can `set a breakpoint
    anywhere you want <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#pdb.set_trace>`_! This can be done with ``breakpoint()``
    in Python 3.7, or ``import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`` in earlier versions.
    
    If you're using `autoreload <https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/config/extensions/autoreload.html>`_ then next time
    you run the code, you'll hit the breakpoint. If you're not using autoreload, you'll either have to use importlib
    to manually reload things, or just restart your IPython session.

    On top of pdb's built-in capabilities, I'd also recommend having a look at `extract <https://andyljones.com/posts/post-mortem-plotting.html>`_.

Demos
    The :github:`demo module <megastep/demo/__init__.py>` has examples of two environments and an example of how to 
    train them.
